<h1>#3  Why living with problems teaches us living a worthful life?</h1>
From the moment we are born we start understanding various forms of living life and the more we deal with the problems the more westart understanding things in a better way. Let's understand this with an example we all are always in search of somethng even if we dont know but we are still working for thise think=gs like being famous, now who does not wants to be famous and n=be known to the whole word? howevr there are also those  aims and goals of ours that we are able to look,like somebody wants to be an architect, a scientist, physicist, an entrepreuner or there are many such professins we want to take up in our future but to reach there is a path which we need to look upon right now and even if you have become someone great that doest=n't means you will stop. we will have to continue our works in order to be a a person capable of doing many things. Human mind is always developing so it becomes one of the most important tasks of us to live with the advancements and technology which is in trend and being used by lots of people because today we live like an average person than in future when human civilization will develop even greater than we may become less than average. For say usually when we prepare ourselvess totally than there are a lot of chances getting ninety eight percent of what we expected similarly if we prepare ourselves for less than hundred percent than the chances are getting less than what we prepared and this really happens.</p>
